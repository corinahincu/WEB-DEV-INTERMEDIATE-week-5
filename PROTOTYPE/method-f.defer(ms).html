  <!--  
    Defer is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a programâ€™s execution, usually for purposes of cleanup. 

    Add method "f.defer(ms)" to functions
importance: 5
Add to the prototype of all functions the method defer(ms), that runs the function after ms milliseconds.

After you do it, such code should work:

function f() {
  alert("Hello!");
}

f.defer(1000); // shows "Hello!" after 1 second
  -->

  <script>
    Function.prototype.defer = function (ms) {
        setTimeout(this, ms);
      };

      function f() {
          alert("Hello!");
        }

        f.defer(1000);
  </script>
